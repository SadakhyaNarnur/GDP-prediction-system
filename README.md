# GDP-prediction-system
GDP prediction system based on public mobility data during Covid - 19

Our GDP Prediction is done based on 9 features of which 5 are mobility related, 1 is Stringency and other 2 are covid related. On cleaning and preprocessing the next step was to model, fit and predict on the data with various models. 

Random Forest-Multi Layer Perceptron Ensemble Model:
The idea is to use MLP neural network to replace decision tree to construct a Random forest and multilayer perceptron model. 

The proposed model RF-MLP Regressor could be used as a new model for other predictions which is an ensemble of Neural Networks within the Random Forest model.
